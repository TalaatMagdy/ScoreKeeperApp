# Score-Keeper-app

![](https://github.com/TalaatMagdy/ScoreKeeperApp/blob/master/screen.png)

The app is done as [Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) project. So I made it project programmatically and will introduce You what I have done overall.

This app keeps score points in the game of `basketball`. The screen is divided into two parts, every part consists of:

1. Player name
2. `TextView` that displays the score 
3. Three buttons:
  1. `+3 Points` button which increasing the score for goal outside the bow
  2. `+2 Points` button which button which increasing the score for goal inside the bow
  3. `+1 Points` button which button which increasing the free Throw
4. `Reset` button which resets the score for both players back to 0
